## Programming paradigms
- object oriented programming (oop)
- functional programming
- procedural programming

### Object Oriented Programming
- uses classes and objects
- make re-usable components
- object refers to an instance or a real entity that follows a blueprint (class)
- objects have attributes and methods
- principles
  - polymorphism
    - objects can have same name but serve different purpose based on use context
    - function overloading (functions can have same name as long as they have different signatures) and overriding (inheritance)
