## Programming paradigms
- object oriented programming (oop)
- functional programming
- procedural programming

### Object Oriented Programming
- uses classes and objects
- make re-usable components
- object refers to an instance or a real entity that follows a blueprint (class)
- objects have attributes and methods
- principles
  - polymorphism
    - objects can have same name but serve different purpose based on use context
    - function overloading (functions can have same name as long as they have different signatures) and overriding (inheritance)
  - inheritance
    - child classes, abstract classes
  - encapsulation
    - wrapping up contents of entity into one unit
    - objects can have private state not accessable by other objects
  - abstraction
    - classes can expose certain data attributes while keeping others private
    - done to make things less complex or more secure
- advantages
  - reusability
  - security
  - maintenance
    - easy to make changes to one obect without affecting other objects
  - inheritance
    - easy to import required functionality from libraries and customize them, thanks to inheritance
- disadvantages
  - programs usually larger
  - beforehand planning of entities that should be modeled as classes
  - steep learning curve
